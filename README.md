# My Emacs Configuration

## Installation on Linux and Mac
* Install Emacs version 25 or higher, install `git`, and run the following:
```shell
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak # Move any preexisting configuration to a backup directory, making it invisible to Emacs 
git clone https://github.com/varun-ramani/config_emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```
* Open Emacs and accept any prompts that show up
* Wait for installation to complete
